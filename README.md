# Twitter Analysis

A project about Twitter Analysis of Big data course

## Goal

Our goal is to find a more efficient way to figure out Twitter uses who obtain a huge influence on others by using big data techniques.

### Prerequisites & Reading materials

Python3.5 Tensorflow 

```
pip install python3
```

Some papers

```

ICDE
Predicting Named Entity Location Using Twitter.

SIGIR
The Evolution of Content Analysis for Personalized Recommendations at Twitter.

AAAI

```

### Procedure

A step by step series of whole procedure that tell you how to finish Twitter analysis.

Say what the step will be

```
1. Prepare dataset. Plan to crawl 10,000 users in Twitter and 100 tweets of each user.

2. Cleaning data and build relation entries of users. Delete some words like 'the', 'a' and some useless blanks. Store user information in database.
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
