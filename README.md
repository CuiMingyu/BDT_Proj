# Twitter Analysis

A project about Twitter Analysis of Big data course

## Goal

Our goal is to find a more efficient way to figure out Twitter uses who obtain a huge influence on others by using big data techniques.

### Prerequisites & Reading materials

```
pip install python3
```

NAACL
Deep Learning for Depression Detection of Twitter Users.
Only consider text of users which have completely dataset.
```

```
Main Idea:
Based on user's actions and tweets to decide whether a user has potential depression.
```


### Procedure

A step by step series of whole procedure that tell you how to finish Twitter analysis.



```
1. Prepare dataset. Plan to crawl 10,000 users in Twitter and 100 tweets of each user and 'following & follower' of each user.

2. Cleaning data and build relation entries of users. Delete some words like 'the', 'a' and some useless blanks. Store user information in database.
```
## Timeline of class

Nov. 5 Proposal

Dec. 3 Proj pre

## Timeline of our progress

* ### Oct. 5 - 11 (researching week & running models)

1. Crawl data : 2 person (needs same as the aaai paper data format)
2. text model : 1 per
3. graph model : 1 per
4. follower/following : 1 per

* ###Oct. 12 - 18 (coding week & combining code)

1. Data part : Washing data &  Splicing data format (1 per)
2. Define api : 1 per
3. Text model coding : 1 per
4. Graph model coding : 1 per 
5. Follower/following coding : 1 per

* ###Oct. 19 - 28 (Combining week & runing model)

We need to combine all code and fix bugs.

* ###Oct. 29 - Nov. 5 (Writing week)

Writing proposal.

* ###Nov. 6 -

Find tricks which can improve our performances.
